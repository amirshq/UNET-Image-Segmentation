# UNET-Image-Segmentation

# U-Net++ Aerial Image Segmentation

## Overview
This project implements U-Net++, an advanced deep learning architecture for semantic segmentation, tailored for high-resolution aerial imagery. Our goal is to accurately segment different features in aerial images, such as buildings, roads, vegetation, and water bodies, which can be crucial for urban planning, environmental monitoring, and geographical mapping.

## Features
- **Advanced Segmentation Model**: Utilizes the U-Net++ architecture for improved segmentation accuracy.
- **High-Resolution Aerial Image Processing**: Optimized for handling and processing high-resolution images from aerial sources.
- **Customizable Layers and Filters**: Easily adjustable layers and filter sizes to adapt to different segmentation needs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or above
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Dataset: Aerial imagery dataset (not included in the repository)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone [repository URL]
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your aerial image dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the training script with the command:
   ```
   python train.py
   ```
3. To perform segmentation on new images, use:
   ```
   python segment.py --image path_to_image.jpg
   ```

## Model Architecture
U-Net++ improves upon the traditional U-Net architecture by introducing a series of nested, dense skip pathways, which provide a more precise segmentation, especially in complex aerial images.
